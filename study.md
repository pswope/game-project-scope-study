# Game Project Scope Study

## Required Readings

-   [Game Project](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project)
-   [Game API](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project-api)
-   [What is a User Story](http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/user-story)

## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss on Monday morning.

Submit detailed answers to these in this file via a pull request.

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
  Wire frame is sketched in my notebook.

-   The data structure you plan to use.
  If I am understanding this question I think an array is the data structure that will be used for the basic game logic.

- How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
  As an array with 3 rows and 3 colums with 3 an indx of 2 fir each.  I will use  json listers to grab the data from the gameboard with .on click functions.

-   How you plan to approach this project.
- I plan to approch the project in small steps.  I would like to address the harder parts first like the coding and logic behind the game play. However, I will follow the steps outlined in the
-
- 4-8 user stories for your game project.
 User Experience-
  User story 1 - As a user, I should see a sign-in sign-up section to enable game play
  User story 2- As a user, I should see the game board on the main page
  User story 3- As a user, I should be able to see game instrutions if needed
  User story 4- As a user, I should be able to place game piecs on the board where I want them to reside.
  User story 5- As a user, I should be able to see the opponent's moves.
  User story 6- As a user, I should be able to see a result of the games out come win, lose or draw.
  User story 7- As a user, I should be able to reset the gane play when appropiate.
  User story 8- As a user, I should be able to see my results with the numner of games played and outcomes on the single page.
  User story 9- As a user, I should be able to store a game to retrive later.
  User story 10- As a user, I should be able to change my password when needed.


-   How you plan to keep your code moodular.
 I will use the examples we have completed in class.  Using seperate files in atom to store the javascript functions, ajax request, event handelers, game logic script, etc.  Using the require function and module exports.

-   What creative spin will you add to your project.
Not quite sure yet but I would like to create an instruction tag that only shows the how to play info when the user hovers the mouse over the tag on the main page.

-   How you will use version control to backup / track your project.

I plan to make multiple commits and push requests through out the project.  Specifically I will give more attention to commits when coding is added and changed.  Commits will be tied to testing intervals to determine if the additions or changes are adding to the success of the final project.  I plan to use specific details in commits to detail the type of file (ex-HTML, JS functions, AJAX, etc.).  I may explore creting muliple branches to store different parts of the project, again like the GFI, account documentation, JS, etc.


-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses.

Not at this time.
